Fixes an issue where the Large Fire from Vanilla Factions Expanded - Tribals constantly sets pawns on fire when Combat Extended is installed.

[h1]The Problem[/h1]
VFET's Large Fire spawns visual sparks every ~0.5 seconds. These sparks use RimWorld's vanilla Spark class which calls FireUtility.TryStartFireIn() on impact. Combat Extended patches this method to add a 50% chance for pawns at that location to catch fire. Combined, this causes pawns near the fire to constantly ignite.

[h1]The Fix[/h1]
This mod replaces VFET's spark with a visual-only version that doesn't attempt to start fires. Campfire sparks are purely decorative and shouldn't be setting pawns ablaze anyway.
